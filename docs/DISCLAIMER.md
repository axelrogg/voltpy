# Normative Disclaimer

Ohmly is an open-source engineering support library, distributed under the
MIT License.

It is intended to assist in the mechanical analysis of overhead conductors, but
it is not a certified calculation tool and does not replace professional
engineering judgment, regulatory review, or a complete project analysis.


## Regulatory Scope

-   Mechanical calculations currently implemented in Ohmly follow Spanish
    regulation ITC-LAT 07 only.
-   No other standards or national codes are supported unless explicitly stated.
-   The user is responsible for ensuring that ITC-LAT 07 is applicable to their
    project and jurisdiction.


## Engineering Responsibility

-   All results must be verified and validated by a qualified engineer before
    being used for design, construction, or regulatory submission.
-   Input data quality and correctness are the sole responsibility of the user.
-   Incorrect assumptions or misuse may result in non-compliant or unsafe
    designs.


## Data and Assumptions

-   Built-in conductor data is based on UNE-EN 50182 standard values.
-   Actual conductor properties may differ depending on manufacturer,
    installation method, accessories, and service conditions.
-   Ohmly allows manual modification of properties to reflect real-world data.


## License and Liability

-   Ohmly is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, as stated in
    the MIT License.
-   The authors and contributors accept no liability for damages, losses, or
    consequences arising from the use of this software.


## Intended Use

-   Suitable for educational, academic, and preliminary engineering studies.
-   Not intended to be used as a standalone compliance or certification tool.
